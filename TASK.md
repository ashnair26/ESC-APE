## ðŸ”Ž Discovered During Work

### Secrets Management System

**Description**: Implement a secure admin dashboard for managing API tokens and other sensitive information. This system should allow administrators to enter API tokens manually and store them securely in Supabase Vault.

**Requirements**:
- Create a secure admin-only UI for entering API tokens and other secrets
- Implement backend routes for storing and retrieving secrets
- Use Supabase Vault for secure storage
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to authorized administrators only
- Ensure all MCP servers retrieve tokens at runtime from the secrets manager, not from hardcoded values
- Support per-Creator API token management

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design database schema for storing access control information
- [ ] Implement core secrets management utilities in `core/secrets.py`
- [ ] Create Supabase Vault integration for secure storage
- [ ] Implement admin API routes for managing secrets
- [ ] Develop admin UI components for the secrets management dashboard
- [ ] Update MCP servers to retrieve tokens from the secrets manager at runtime
- [ ] Implement RBAC to restrict access to authorized administrators
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for the secrets management system
